## 🎯 Positioning Statement

*"I took a weak prototype and turned it into a production-ready, extensible CTA experiment with a clear layout system, responsive SCSS, and clean JS API hooks. The checkered grid layout creates clear visual hierarchy, scales seamlessly across 100s of devices, and uses a data-role architecture that makes future A/B test iterations trivial. This code is ready to be seen by millions of players and maintained by tens of developers."*
